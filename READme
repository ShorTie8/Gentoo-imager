Some simple script's to make a very basic headless Gentoo pi image.
Can be run on either raspios or Gentoo.
Login root/root

usage: ./Gentoo-imager.sh
       ./Gentoo-imager.sh armhf, for armhf on arm64

If you include a wpa_supplicant.conf either here or in /boot,
It will copy it to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf on 1st boot,
As growpart.init expands / to the full device.

I've ported and included dphys-swapfile for a swap file.
Size can be adjust in /etc/dphys-swapfile.
